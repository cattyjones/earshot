# Earshot

Turn Slack conversations into blog posts with AI.

## üß† Overview

**Earshot** is a Slack bot that listens for mentions in threads, captures the full conversation, and uses **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** from Anthropic to generate a structured, high-quality blog post. The final output is delivered directly into the Slack thread as a formatted `.txt` file.
