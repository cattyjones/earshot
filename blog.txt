Here is a draft blog post based on the Slack discussion:

Driving Organic Reach on Social Channels: A Content Strategy Framework

Our social channels content needs a reset to maximize organic reach and traffic. All content should aim to:

Provide Value: Educate and inform audiences with insightful, useful information.

Spark Inspiration: Give builders ideas on what they can create.  

Communicate Our Product: Convey the core value prop of our full-stack and individual products.

Some content formats we should focus on:

Educational Threads: Expert topics like EIP-7702, ERC-7857, and LINE Mini Apps. 

Thought Leadership: Share innovative ideas and perspectives.  

Demos/Builds: Apps built with our full-stack. Aim for 1 per week, with monthly contributions from devs.   

Customer Milestones: Highlight customer successes and case studies.   

Do Less Of:

Chain Announcements: Only cover top, Tier 1 chains.   

Event Announcements: Usually only relevant to attendees. Email them instead.

An example of a highly sharable format: Shorts that combine "how to build this app" + an inspiring user story + highlighting our product's role via case studies. For example, a mini-game that went viral with 250K players without needing an app store, showing how our tools enabled seamless onboarding and gasless transactions.  

The key is making Web3 feel like Web2 so the next billion users can easily get onboarded. Our toolkit abstracts away blockchain complexity so anyone can build apps with smart contracts.  

What ideas could you bring to life if Web3 onboarding wasn't an obstacle? Share your app concepts below!
