Here is a draft blog post based on the Slack discussion:

Better Execution Over Faster Speed

In a recent Slack conversation, the team discussed an important tradeoff in blockchain development - is it more important to optimize for speed or reliability? The consensus was that while speed is important, consistent and reliable execution is far more critical for earning user trust. 

As one member put it, "speed will not earn user trust, execution consistency and stability will." Just as people are willing to wait slightly longer for a package delivery if it ultimately arrives intact, blockchain users care more that their transactions are processed correctly rather than instantly. The execution needs to be "quasi-guaranteed," even if that means a reasonable processing delay.

The team drew parallels to real-world financial transactions - when moving money between bank accounts, for example, people care more about accuracy than raw speed. The same mentality should apply to blockchain interactions. Setting up event webhooks or merchant accounts is another example where reliability trumps real-timeness. 

One quote summed it up well: "We win by earning trust through feature completeness and reliability and not only by making sure we deliver outputs for tiktok attention spanned humans." While speed is important, the blockchain industry needs to focus first on bulletproof execution, stability, and robustness. Only then will mainstream users truly trust the technology day-to-day.

The Slack conversation revealed that behind any good blockchain lies an intense focus on the fundamentals - trustworthy execution above all else. Sacrificing some speed for better reliability seems a wise tradeoff as the technology matures.
