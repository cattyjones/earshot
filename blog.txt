Quality Over Speed: Why Blockchain Reliability Matters More Than Raw Performance 

A recent debate on a blockchain development Slack channel highlighted an important discussion - is it more important for blockchain platforms to focus on faster transaction speeds or on ensuring reliable execution?

The consensus from experienced developers was that consistency and reliability should be prioritized over raw speed. As one developer put it, "better output is more important than speed." People are willing to wait slightly longer for something of higher quality.  

When users interact with any system, whether setting up a merchant account or exchanging currency, what matters most is having confidence that things will work as expected. Users want assurance that transactions and notifications won't get lost and that there are mechanisms to remedy issues if they occur.  

As another developer argued, "engine making sure execution is quasi-guaranteed is more important than making the tx get to that mined status faster." Fast blockchain speeds may seem impressive at first glance, but they don't earn long-term user trust. What builds trust is execution consistency over the long haul.

The key takeaway is that while raw performance benchmarks are easy marketing wins, what really matters is dependable real-world operation over years of production use. Fast and flashy loses its luster quickly if users encounter reliability issues down the line. As builders of mission-critical blockchain infrastructure, we should optimize for boringness - prioritizing stability and robustness over all else. The users and systems that depend on us will thank us in the long run.
