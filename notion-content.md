# **Universal Bridge: Unifying Ethereum's Assets**

Over the past several years, rollup activity has replaced mainnet's. This brought a golden age of onchain app development. For a fraction of a cent, users can execute transactions almost instantly. Developers can choose to build on a chain that’s engineered with their app and its community in mind. At thirdweb, we’ve been at the front lines of this transition. We were one of the first to bet on the "any EVM" vision, supporting all 2,588 chains and counting. This means handling any edge cases between chains so developers don't have to. Regardless of where you deploy your app, thirdweb gives you the same tools to build.

Then, we did it for account abstraction. Developers can add gas sponsorships or batched transactions to any app in a single line of code. Rather than implementing EIPs, you can focus on building apps, because that’s what you set out to do.

This isn't limited to web apps, either. We've built tools for mobile apps, Unity, Unreal, Telegram, LINE, AI, and more. Thirdweb is universal. But your onchain assets? They're locally restricted. Despite so much diversity among EVM chains, most users limit themselves to a select few. Moving between chains is slow, tedious, and leaves funds isolated from the apps you use most often.

![](https://blog.thirdweb.com/content/images/2025/02/image-10.png)

This fragmentation isn't a secret, and there are plenty of teams trying to address it. But this is creating the same problem for developers as we saw with L2s. Integrating all bridging protocols is impossible, and knowing which to use is confusing. It’s the classic “14 competing standards” problem. Every new solution increases the difficulty for developers to use any of them.

Developers can only serve the users of their supported chains, and users can only access that chain's assets. This contradicts blockchains' promise of interoperability. For true interoperability, assets shouldn't be bound to one or a few chains.

![](https://blog.thirdweb.com/content/images/2025/02/5.--4-.png)

## **Introducing: Universal Bridge**

Thirdweb made chains universal; now we’re making the assets on them universal. The most promising use case of blockchains is borderless, uncensorable assets and data. Isolating assets to a single chain is no better than isolating assets to a single country, or data to a single app. For users to control their own assets, they need to be usable anywhere. They need to be universal.

We're building the tools and infrastructure to use any asset on any chain. No, we're not building a 15th bridging standard. The world doesn't need another "modular intents-driven cross-chain interoperability protocol." At thirdweb we build tools, not EIPs. We make it easy to use all existing interoperability protocols from our full-stack tools and APIs.

This mission goes well beyond on-ramping, off-ramping, or bridging crypto. It includes everyday app interactions like collecting an NFT on Zora, swapping tokens on Unichain, or creating a Farcaster account on Optimism. Holding assets on a specific chain will no longer be a prerequisite for using an app. Thirdweb will route assets and data from one chain to another with no developer overhead.

As part of this mission, what’s known as thirdweb Pay is now consolidated into Connect. This is a key part of the onchain stack, and we’re connecting it directly to our other tools. We’ll continue to add complementary features like webhooks, transaction bookkeeping, and more. They’ll be available for free to every developer using thirdweb.

![](https://blog.thirdweb.com/content/images/2025/02/5.--5-.png)

We’ve already made [UI improvements and added over 1,000 routes](https://blog.thirdweb.com/changelog/introducing-universal-bridge/) to our existing components. In the coming weeks, we’ll be releasing more routes, APIs, and frontend components. Transacting with any contract on any chain should feel as simple as using your own database.

Developers build with thirdweb across thousands of chains for users in hundreds of countries and on dozens of platforms. Universal Bridge makes it possible to do the same across chains. We can't wait to keep building the Universal Bridge to discover what developers create with it.

# **Free and Valuable**

**Solving the internet’s longest standing problem.**

Published February 28, 2025

![](https://jacob.energy/img/free-valuable-hero.png)

*“Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive. ...That tension will not go away.”* — Stewart Brand

The internet is half complete. It is able to transfer information across the world between billions of people. That’s the first half of the machine. The second—and incomplete—half is how the value system allows that information to be as free (and widely spread) as possible.

We’ve made it this far with walled gardens built out of a combination of ads, subscriptions, and paywalls. It’s important that there is a viable business model for creating and distributing information. Without that incentive there would be much less produced, reducing the amount of knowledge being widely available.

The problem is that our current business models are directly at odds with the free distribution of information. There is a real and persistent tension between the two. We need to restrict access to extract value. It’s fighting gravity.

This is the largest and most fundamental problem with the internet as it is today. We have yet to find a way to solve the tension of information wanting to be free and the fact that information is expensive to produce, distribute and consume.

### **What if?**

What if we could have a value system that wants information to be as freely distributed as possible?

What if we could have a value system that rewarded the creators, distributors and consumers of information without any restrictions on the access to that information? And even better, what if there was a value system that created a direct and explicit incentive to spread that information as far and wide as possible?

Such a value system would be the perfect complement to information. In fact it would probably become synonymous with the information itself.

### **Crypto is the solution**

My very important truth that few people agree with me on is that we can use crypto to create the value system for information and solve this fundamental problem with the internet.

We can do that by making it as easy as possible for anyone to coin their content (any media), making it freely accessible across the internet while creating an open, liquid, permissionless and programmable market to discover and trade its value in real time.

The more widely spread and traded, the more valuable it can become. Creators capture value in the coins they own. Platforms capture value when they show the right coins to the right people at the right time. Consumers capture value by owning the coins for the content they find important, fun and useful to them. It’s a win-win-win.

### **Towards a free and valuable internet**

Coins unlock a free and valuable internet—one where information can be freely accessed and shared while the value of that information finds its way into all of the hands that help create, distribute, and consume it.

This is a new paradigm where information and value converge to create information markets. These markets give us a crucial new tool to help us organize and sort through an increasingly infinite sea of content in an adversarial environment. This will not only create more aligned incentives for content production and distribution, but at the highest level helps us discover the most important and valuable things on the internet. At their best, free markets are truth machines, and now we get to apply them to the internet itself. It's not just the price and marketcap, but being able to see who is doing what and with how much. These are valuable signals to help us make sense of what to pay attention to.

There's a lot to figure out, but in an internet dominated by closed algorithms that are working against us and our attention—we now have a new algorithm called the market we can start to utilize. Like how social media unlocked an entire new universe of opportunities, I have no doubt that this will unlock the same—with the added superpowers that crypto affords in permissionless and open protocols. I have no doubt what starts as a new way to create and share content on the internet will lead to new types of communities and organizations that can do things together at scales not possible before.

After five years of building, we have a working spark. But most of the work remains ahead. At Zora, that's our mission: to build the free and valuable internet.

# **A Marketing Mantra for Founders**

By [Rachael Horwitz](https://warpcast.com/rachaelrad)

The noise level in crypto can be . . . a lot, especially when we’re on the upswing of a cycle. Founders should only expect things to get louder online and onchain as an increasing number of projects compete for mindshare among developers and early adopters. Information is near-infinite; attention remains scarce.

During my time in this space (leading comms at Coinbase and counseling Haun portfolio companies) I’ve watched promising projects get lost in the wash. Lately I've been sharing with founders a little phrase that I was taught in the early days of my comms career while at Google (~2005). If you’re building in crypto right now, consider as your mantra: *Repetition doesn't spoil the prayer.*

This line comes from a book called [*How Google Works*](https://www.amazon.com/How-Google-Works-Eric-Schmidt/dp/1455582328) by [Eric Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt) and [Jonathan Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenberg_(technologist)). Here’s how they describe what they mean by this phrase:

> In most aspects of life, you need to say something about twenty times before it truly starts to sink in. Say it a few times, people are too busy to even notice. A few more times, they start to become aware of a vague buzzing in their ears. By the time you’ve repeated it fifteen to twenty times you may be completely sick of it, but that’s about the time that people are starting to get it.
> 

For crypto, I think of this mantra as the key to brand building in the early days. Ours is a frenetic, memetic ecosystem and, while counterintuitive, our industry actually ends up *rewarding* messengers that are focused, repetitive, and disciplined (in addition to other virtues, namely transparency and authenticity). It makes sense when you think about it: what is a meme if not something posted over and over again? It's the repetition that gives it power.

So what does this look like in practice for crypto brands?

First, write it down. This is **step one**. Define a core message—a clear and concise statement that captures who you are and what you do. This message should be rooted in what your project offers to your most important audience (devs? traders? other crypto projects?). You can and should consider other audiences because they're listening but communicate directly to the most important group you are building for. Your message should also express your team’s core values.

At Coinbase, we distilled our positioning into the phrase, "Trusted, safe, and easy to use." This message became a guiding principle for our marketing, content creation, [media outreach](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/move-deliberately-fix-things-how-coinbase-is-building-a-cryptocurrency-empire/2018/05/17/623d950c-587c-11e8-858f-12becb4d6067_story.html), and even our approach to attracting top talent. In order to reach new people with this message and fast, we knew we needed to kinda meme it into existence. And so we did—we said it over and over and over again. To Twitter at the time (now X), to journalists, to politicians, to current employees and new employees. We layered those words into the product and we baked it into our culture documents and values. We built a strong foundation for the brand and since then the excellent marketing team there has layered onto that foundation a new set of messages including “update the system” as the company has matured and grown.

So yes, **step two** is repeating the prayer diligently. How does this manifest tactically? Take for example security. If “security” is at the forefront of your value proposition, weave that message into every possible facet of your outreach. Share content about the latest in security practices even if it doesn't apply specifically to your product experience. Chime in to online security conversations. Ensure the copy across your website (including your jobs page) highlights your commitment to security. Connect every new announcement to the higher goal of security. Be transparent, over-communicate, and invite your community on the journey with you.

"Repeating the prayer" also requires message discipline. This is **step three**. Don't get derailed by distractions or be tempted to engage in conversations that veer wildly off-course from your core values. I can’t tell you how many times founders ask me if they should weigh in on random rumors or topics (especially when a competitor is involved) and how almost always my answer is “I wouldn’t.” Too many messages and value propositions coming from a brand is *dilutive.* Staying focused, disciplined, and “on message” consistently for a very long time is *compounding.* It builds dividends.

Some founders I’ve worked with are hesitant to head down this path because they’re worried they’ll be perceived as overly promotional. But the same principle I've seen countless times working with founders or execs preparing for a live television interview or a speaking appearance applies here. Most people have an instinct to underplay their passion publicly. What feels like overselling to you is likely just reaching the baseline needed to resonate within the community and eventually among employees. When you think you're being loud, you're probably only at a 5 out of 10.

I like to set time-related goals to test how things are going. Six months is a solid amount of time to start hearing your message come back to you. An exercise that might help: imagine yourself at the end of the year at a conference. You meet someone and they mention your project or product. What do you hope they say about what you’re building? Or what it's like to work with your team? Or what they're hearing about what it's like to work *on* your team? What are the specific words you hope they are using? That's your prayer. Repeat it consistently and connect everything you do back to that message.

Our industry is full of ideas, projects, and promises. Focused repetition is more powerful than a billboard or an ad and by the way, it’s free. That’s how, in the early days, you ensure that your message cuts through the noise.

Minting is usually done by the creator of the token (the default admin), but can also be done by anyone who has been given [permission](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Permissions) to mint tokens by the creator.
* [NFT](/glossary/nft): A Non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token that represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. It is defined by the [ERC-721 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), which is a standard for creating NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. This is in contrast to ERC-20 tokens, which are 1:1 exchangeable.
* [Non-Custodial Wallet](/glossary/non-custodial-wallet): A non-custodial wallet (also known as a self-custody wallet) is a wallet where the user has full control of their security & assets. The user is solely responsible for the security of their private key and therefore their funds. Examples of non-custodial wallets are Coinbase Wallet, Electron, and Ledger.
* [Paymaster](/glossary/paymaster): A paymaster is a smart contract that relays transactions. It provides a service that enables a third party to pay the transaction fee on behalf of the user by funding the paymaster in advance. The Paymaster acts as a gas reserve which then can be used during the call execution via the`EntryPoint` contract.
* [Permissionless](/glossary/permissionless): On the context of smart contracts, permissionless means that anyone can interact with the contract without needing special permission or approval. Smart contracts can be deployed on public blockchains like Ethereum, promoting open access and transparency. While anyone can interact with a permissionless smart contract, the contract's code may still limit certain operations (like modifying the contract or accessing certain data) to specific roles, such as the contract's owner or creator.
* [Gasless Transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions): Gasless Transactions, also known as meta-transactions, are transactions that have the [gas fee](/glossary/gas)paid for by a third party instead of the transaction sender. Typically, this means the dApp owner covers the gas costs of their users' transactions, providing a more seamless user experience.
* [Proxy Contracts](/glossary/proxy-contracts): A Proxy smart contract contains the [Storage](/storage) for an upgradable contract that allows you to modify its logic post-deployment.
* [RPC URLs](/glossary/rpc): An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) URL is an endpoint that enables an application to communicate with a blockchain network. It is used to send requests (initiate transactions) and receive responses (read data) from the blockchain, enabling developers to build applications that interact with the blockchain.
* [Signature-based Minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting): Signature-based minting, or "on-demand minting" allows a smart contract admin to generate signatures that can be used by other wallets to allow them to mint tokens on your smart contract in real-time.
* [Smart Contract](/glossary/smart-contract): A smart contract is a computer program, stored on the blockchain. Smart contracts allow trustless transactions to be executed without third parties - the smart contract enforces the rules of the transaction automatically. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.
* [ThirdwebTransaction Instance Methods](/dotnet/transactions/instance): The `ThirdwebTransaction` class provides a set of instance methods to set various properties of your transaction's input data and gas settings.
* [Soulbound Tokens](/glossary/soulbound): Soulbound tokens refer to NFTs that are permanently attached to a specific wallet address on the blockchain.
* [Smart Account](/glossary/smart-wallet): A Smart Account is a wallet that is controlled by a smart contract following the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).
* [Staking](/glossary/staking): Staking is the process of locking up tokens to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return for staking, users receive rewards in the form of additional tokens. Staking is a key element of Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, which are used by many blockchains to secure their networks.
* [IThirdwebWallet.Disconnect](/dotnet/wallets/actions/disconnect): This method cleanly disconnects the wallet instance from the blockchain network or any related services, effectively ending the session.
* [Token](/glossary/token): A token is a type of digital asset that represents a particular value or utility. Tokens are defined by smart contracts which follow a token standard such as the ERC-20, ERC-1155 or ERC-721 standards.
* [Wallet](/glossary/wallet): A wallet is a user's way of interacting with the blockchain. Wallets can be used to store, send, and receive blockchain assets such as ERC-20 tokens and NFTS.
* [Initializing a Thirdweb Client](/dotnet/client): The `ThirdwebClient` class is the main entry point for interacting with the Thirdweb SDK.
